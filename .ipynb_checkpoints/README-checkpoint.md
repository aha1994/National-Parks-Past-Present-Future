# National-Parks-Past-Present-Future
This project incorporated web scraping, API calls, and JavaScript/Html/Css in order to create an interactive web page to visualize information about US National Parks. The user has the ability to toggle between looking at national park visitation, historical climate data, as well as projected climate data using an interactive Leaflet.Js map. The user can also view alerts from the National Park Service for each of the National Parks with the dropdown below the map. 

# Requirements
The layout of the page was built using components from https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/. The interactive map is built from https://leafletjs.com/, and requires an api key in order to use. Park alert data was pulled from the National Park Service API https://www.nps.gov/subjects/digital/nps-data-api.htm.
